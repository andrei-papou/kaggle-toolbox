    title: Position-wise Feed-Forward Network (FFN)
    summary: Documented reusable implementation of the position wise feedforward network.

    # Position-wise Feed-Forward Network (FFN)
    This is a [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org)  implementation
    of position-wise feedforward network used in transformer.
    FFN consists of two fully connected layers.
    Number of dimensions in the hidden layer $d_{ff}$, is generally set to around
    four times that of the token embedding $d_{model}$.
    So it is sometime also called the expand-and-contract network.
    There is an activation at the hidden layer, which is
    usually set to ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) activation, $$\\max(0, x)$$
    That is, the FFN function is,
    $$FFN(x, W_1, W_2, b_1, b_2) = \\max(0, x W_1 + b_1) W_2 + b_2$$
    where $W_1$, $W_2$, $b_1$ and $b_2$ are learnable parameters.
    Sometimes the
    GELU (Gaussian Error Linear Unit) activation is also used instead of ReLU.
    $$x \\Phi(x)$$ where $\\Phi(x) = P(X \\le x), X \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0,1)$
    ### Gated Linear Units
    This is a generic implementation that supports different variants including
    [Gated Linear Units](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.05202) (GLU).
